# TARC_2017
This is the official repo for the Campolindo High School Team America Rocketry Challenge team.
## First goal [Done]
Create an arduino program that takes an altitude the user inputs and moves a servo when the target altitude is reached, uses the MPL3115A2 - I2C altimeter.
## Next Steps [To do]
1. Download the [Bluno Beetle app APK](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DFRobot/BlunoBasicDemo/master/Android/BlunoBasicDemo.apk), install and run it on your Android phone. Please note that getting this app for iOS will require you to compile the app from source, which does not sound fun. Please refer to [this webpage](https://www.dfrobot.com/wiki/index.php/Bluno_SKU:DFR0267#Bluno_Basic_Demo) for more information.
2. Click the `scan` button and select the Bluno Beetle (might have a different name).
3. Once you're connected, you should see the altitude readings in meters.
### PLEASE DON'T FORGET TO GIVE MEANINGFUL VALUES TO THE CONSTANTS IN `Rocket1.ino` THAT ARE CURRENTLY NOT ASSIGNED ANYTHING, ELSE THE CODE WILL NOT COMPILE.
### Please don't change the directory structure of the project. Download the code and only change `README.md` and `Rocket1.ino` files.
